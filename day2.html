        What does 'req' and 'res' stand for? Request (the URL, params, and queries) and Response (how we want to
        respond to the request. Yesterday we sent am html file back. You can also send a status code or a console log
        etc...)

    <p>How to start an app:
        <li>make a server.js file</li>
        <li>initialize npm: type "npm init -y" in console </li>
        <li>install express: type "npm i express" in console</li>
        <li>make a .gitignore file in the root folder</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>3 lines to start your server (type it in server.js) below:</li>
    <ul>const express = require('express'</ul>
    <ul>const app = express()</ul>
    <ul>app.listen(3000)</ul>
    </p>
    </li>
    </p>
    <p>type in "nodemon" in the console. Everytime u make a change and save, it will restart the server.</p>

    <h1>How to use a request query to call a name that the user types in</h1>
    <p>add to the url: ?n=John Doe</p>
    <p>gives request query... </p>
    <img src="./pics/day2f.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>Console log req.query</h1>
    <p>"req.query" is actually and object with the key value pair that we created in the previous screenshot. (n=John
        Doe)</p>
    <img src="./pics/day2g.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>Multiple "req.query" separated by an "&"</h1>
    <img src="./pics/day2h.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>Now type req.query.n to get the value of "n" (in this case John Doe)</h1>
    <img src="./pics/day2i.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>Now take the req.query.n and use it in a temperate literal inside the res.send.</h1>
    <img src="./pics/day2j.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>Now you the user can enter any name</h1>
    <img src="./pics/day2k.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>Now for request.params ...They are more specified.</h1>
    <p>Params are variable values that appear on your route. You express them in your route's pattern.</p>

    <h1>Now let's console log it</h1>
    <img src="./pics/day2m.png" alt="">

    <h1>Now send it back in a greeting in a temperate literal</h1>
    <img src="./pics/day2n.png" alt="">
    <p>"localhost:3000/name" does not exist anymore. </p>
    <p>
        Now it's specific and the user has to put in a name. Example:
        "localhost:3000/name/Brian"</p>

    <h1>TO DO LIST ACTIVITY!!</h1>
    <p>
    in order to make a to do list app, we need to be able to create to do list items. In order to do that we need a
        post route. We can't get data out of it, so we need to setup our app to accept JSON data. In order to do that we
        need to declare something called "middleware"
        middlewear steps in between your front end and backend.
    </p>
    <p>the way that you declare middleware is with a method in express app called "app.use()"</p>

    <h1>You can use one line to hookup all your front end files.  Requirement needs to have a public folder, and the main html page has to be named index.html</h1>
    <p><h3>So this is the real boiler plate:</h3></p>
    <p>const express = require('express') <br>
        const { join } = require('path') <br>
        
        const app = express() <br>

        <br>
        app.use(express.static(join(__dirname, 'public'))) <br>
        app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })) <br>
        app.use(express.json()) <br>
        
        app.use(require('./routes')) <br>
        <br>
        app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000) <br>
