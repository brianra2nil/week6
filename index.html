    <p>copy the results and paste them in a file you create called .gitignore in the root directory of your app</p>

    <h1>The old way to build servers in NODE before Express was created. Probably not going to get used very much.
        Likely that all companies use Express.</h1>
    <img src="./pics/day1c.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>Now the "better" way to build servers with EXPRESS. https://expressjs.com/</h1>
    <p>Make a "server.js" file, then type in the console: "npm init -y" to initialize</p>
    <p>Type "npm i express" in the console to install the express package</p>
    <p>NOTE: if you cloned a repository, just type "npm i" to get all the packages it used. The above is only if you are
        starting the app from your local computer</p>
    <p>NOW TO BRING EXPRESS INTO OUR PAGE WITH 3 LINES OF CODE BELOW:</p>
    <img src="./pics/day1d.png" alt="">
    <p>Line 1 is to bring in the express package</p>
    <p>Line 2 is to create an express server. We like to call it "app'"</p>
    <p>Line 3 is to tell the app to listen on a port. 3000 is common dev practice</p>
    <p>Now you can start the server by typing in the console: "node server.js" *nothing happens in browser</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>How to use the "app.get()" method to handle get requests.</h1>
    <p>app.get('/test', () => { <br><br> })</p>
    <p>The above means when you run "localhost:3000/test" in the browser you will define what happens with this
        function. We will try it with a console log below:</p>
    <img src="./pics/day1e.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <p>
    <h1>Now we add req and res and we can send things to the browser as a response (when you type "localhost:3000/test")
        </p>
    </h1>
    <img src="./pics/day1f.png" alt="">
    <hr>

    <h1>"res.json()" lets you send back javascript data like an object:</p>
    </h1>
    <img src="./pics/day1g.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <p>
    <h1>"res.sendFile()" lets you send a file, like an html file to render on the browser, by providing the file path.
        </p>
    </h1>
    <img src="./pics/day1h.png" alt="">
    <p>The code above only works if your "index.html" is in the same folder as your "server.js:</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>it's best practice to put your front end files like "index.html" in a folder called "public" to make your folder
        look more clean</h1>
    <p>Now that we changed the file path, we also have to change the code so our app can find "index.html" it's no
        longer in the same folder as "server.js"</p>

    <h1>THE ACTIVITY OF YOUR FAVORITES (MOVIES, SONGS, FOOD, GAMES</h1>
    write the "app.get()"" code 4 times for movies, songs, food, games.
    <img src="./pics/day1i.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>create four .html files for movies, songs, food, games, with a simple h1 tag to render on the screen.</h1>
    <p>remember to put your front end files in a "public" folder.</p>
    <img src="./pics/day1k.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>Now to use the res.sendFile() to render your html files in the browser</h1>
    <p> **Adding in a little bit of de-structuring:</p>
    <h1>BEFORE DE-STRUCTURE:</h1>
    <img src="./pics/day1l.png" alt="">
    <h1>AFTER DE-STRUCTURE:</h1>
    <img src="./pics/day1m.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>Reapeat for all four categories/.html files</h1>
    <img src="./pics/day1n.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>save your work and start your server by typing "node server.js" in the console.</h1>
    <p>type the address in the browser: localhost:3000/games and you should see the html file render:</p>
    <img src="./pics/day1o.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>CONGRATULATIONS!!! YOU RENDERED AN HTML FILE TO THE FRONT END by CODING IN THE BACKEND!!! Now for POST/PUT/and
        DELETE</h1>
    <p>-Download Postman @ https://www.postman.com/downloads/</p>
    <p>Open postman and then sign up or sign in.</p>
    <p>Click on "launchpad" and then "create a request"</p>
    <img src="./pics/day1p.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>You should end up on this screen:</h1>
    <p>if you type "localhost:3000/games" like before, you can see the html file.</p>
    <img src="./pics/day1q.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>Now add a line of code for "post"</h1>
    <p>remember to save and stop and restart your server. CTRL+c to stop. node server.js to start</p>
    <img src="./pics/day1r.png" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1>Now this is how the post will look based on the code entered:</h1>
    <img src="./pics/day1s.png" alt="">
    <p>Note: an "app.get" in your code will not work with an "app.post" in postman. Both the verb and the route need to match for it to
        trigger. This also means you can use '/movies' for different verbs without conflictS.
