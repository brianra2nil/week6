<h1>The old way to build servers in NODE before Express was created.  Probably not going to get used very much.  Likely that all companies use Express.</h1>

<hr>
<h1>Now the "better" way to build servers with EXPRESS.  https://expressjs.com/</h1>
<p>Make a "server.js" file, then type in the console: "npm init -y" to initialize</p>
<p>Type "npm i express" in the console to install the express package</p>
<p>NOW TO BRING EXPRESS INTO OUR PAGE WITH 3 LINES OF CODE BELOW:</p>
<img src="./pics/day1d.png" alt="">
<p>Line 1 is to bring in the express package</p>
<p>Line 2 is to create an express server.  We like to call it "app'"</p>
<p>Line 3 is to tell the app to listen on a port.  3000 is common dev practice</p>
<p>Now you can start the server by typing in the console: "node server.js"  *nothing happens in browser</p>
<hr>
<h1>How to use the "app.get()" method to handle get requests.</h1>
<p>app.get('/test', () => { <br><br> })</p>
<p>The above means when you run "localhost:3000/test" in the browser you will define what happens with this function.  We will try it with a console log below:</p>

<hr>
<p><h1>Now we add req and res and we can send things to the browser as a response (when you type "localhost:3000/test")</p></h1>

<hr>
<p><h1>"res.json()" lets you send back javascript data like an object:</p></h1>
<img src="./pics/day1g.png" alt="">
<hr>
<p><h1>"res.sendFile()" lets you send a file, like an html file to render on the browser, by providing the file path.</p></h1>
<img src="./pics/day1h.png" alt="">
<p>The code above only works if your "index.html" is in the same folder as your "server.js:</p>
<hr>
<h1>it's best practice to put your front end files like "index.html" in a folder called "public" to make your folder look more clean</h1>
<p>Now that we changed the file path, we also have to change the code so our app can find "index.html" it's no longer in the same folder as "server.js"</p>

<h1>THE ACTIVITY OF YOUR FAVORITES (MOVIES, SONGS, FOOD, GAMES</h1>
write the "app.get()"" code 4 times for movies, songs, food, games.

<h1>create four .html files for movies, songs, food, games, with a simple h1 tag to render on the screen.</h1>
<p>remember to put your front end files in a "public" folder.</p>
